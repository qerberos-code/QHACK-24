Name: Angus Chen www.linkedin.com/in/anguschencybersecurity

I am interested in making the world a safer place.
I am currently looking for interdisciplinary cybersecurity problem sets in digital twin, quantum computing, or AI. One of my current projects is leading an Innovative Investigator proposal on cybersecurity of critical infrastructure - power grid with Cyber@ MIT Sloan (Dr. Michael Siegel and Dr. Ranjan Pal) and a few researchers.  Another pet project is to write a chapter published by Springer that I co-authored with Dr. Stephane Mondoloni, who is an MIT alumni for the Father of Digital Twins, Dr. Michael Grevies, and Dr. Ed Hua.
I am looking to collaborate on hackathons and CTF, gain experience, and have fun.
Fun fact: I am a rock climber doing trail running in winter. I have a small terrier Matcha who can run long distances at the speed of quantum.
