# QHACK-24
-👋 Hi, We're Qerberos Team-QHACK 24
-👀 We're interested in quantum  Machine Learning
-🌱 We're  currently learning quantum computing
-💞️ We're  looking to collaborate on hackathon and CTF.
-📫 How to reach us @qerberos-code-QHACK24
-😄 Pronouns: we
-⚡ Fun fact: We first met virtually on the Lunar New Year.

## Hello, everyone from around the world!    We are looking for teammates.  We would like to invite you to join us!!!  

## We are the Qerberos team: 1 cybersecurity professional with diverse backgrounds in Computer Science (python programming), cybersecurity, math and management, and 1 Quantum Machine Learning engineer . We are Angus Chen, and Sabarikirishwaran Ponnambalam (Sabari). We are looking for 2 teammates with strong quantum physics/computing experience.  

Angus has been working on interdisciplinary cybersecurity problem sets in digital twin, quantum computing, or AI. One of my current projects is leading an Innovative Investigator proposal on cybersecurity of critical infrastructure - power grid with Cyber@ MIT Sloan (Dr. Michael Siegel and Dr. Ranjan Pal) and a few researchers.  Another pet project is to write a chapter published by Springer that I co-authored with Dr. Stephane Mondoloni, who is an MIT alumni for the Father of Digital Twins, Dr. Michael Grevies, and Dr. Ed Hua.

Sabari has 2+ years of experience in quantum. his area of expertise is with QML. Previous, He developed QGAN for small molecular drug generation using qiskit and pennylane. Currently working at qubrid developing on hybrid classical quantum algorithms for real world applications. he has experience in working with cuQuantum as well


## In addition to the virtual challenge, there are 3 challenges this team faces in this hackathon: 
## 1) The knowledge of quantum computing, 
## 2) The caliber of participants, 
## 3) our first time working together. 
## Since this hackathon time is finite, we would like to take on only one of 3 challenges, which is working together well. By doing that, we build a better team to take on other hackathons and Capture the Flag (CTF).
