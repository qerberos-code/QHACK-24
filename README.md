- ⚡ Fun fact:

## Hello, everyone from around the world!    We are looking for teammates.  We would like to invite you to join us!!!  

## We are the Qerberos team interested in IonQ challenge. We are 3 cybersecurity professionals with diverse backgrounds in Computer Science (python programming), cybersecurity, math and management. We are Angus Chen, Victor Liang, Hari Pranav Arun Kumar, and Devin Bae, Alba Aparicio Perez. We are recruiting 2 teammates with strong quantum physics/computing experience.  

## In addition to the virtual challenge, there are 3 challenges this team faces in this hackathon: 
## 1) The knowledge of quantum computing, 
## 2) The caliber of participants, 
## 3) our first time working together. 
## Since this hackathon time is finite, we would like to take on only one of 3 challenges, which is working together well. By doing that, we build a better team to take on other hackathons and Capture the Flag (CTF).
