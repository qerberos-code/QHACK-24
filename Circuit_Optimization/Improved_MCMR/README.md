# Quantum Circuit Optimization Techniques

## Background

Quantum circuit optimization is the process of making quantum circuits more efficient for execution on quantum computers by simplifying them and reducing their resource requirements. This involves minimizing the number of quantum gates and the circuit's depth, improving qubit utilization, adapting circuits to hardware constraints, and employing strategies for error mitigation. The goal is to achieve reliable and efficient quantum computations despite the challenges of noise, decoherence, and limited qubit connectivity inherent in current quantum technology. This optimization is crucial for enhancing the performance and feasibility of quantum computing applications.

## Qubit-Reuse Compilation with Mid-Circuit Measurement and Reset

A number of commercially available quantum computers, such as those based on trapped-ion or superconducting qubits, can now perform mid-circuit measurements and resets. This capability is crucial for quantum error correction and can help reduce the number of qubits needed to execute many types of quantum algorithms. By measuring qubits as early as possible, resetting them, and reusing them elsewhere in the circuit, the number of required qubits can be significantly reduced. We introduce qubit-reuse compilation, which optimizes quantum circuits for qubit reuse through an exact constraint programming optimization model and a greedy heuristic. We also introduce the concept of dual circuits and illustrate the performance of these algorithms on relevant near-term quantum circuits and the quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to the MaxCut problem. Experimental realization on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum processor demonstrates the practical benefits of these techniques.

## Quarl: A Learning-Based Quantum Circuit Optimizer

Optimizing quantum circuits poses challenges due to the large search space of functionally equivalent circuits and the need for transformations that may initially decrease performance. Quarl is a learning-based quantum circuit optimizer that addresses these challenges using reinforcement learning (RL), a novel neural architecture, and an RL-training procedure. By decomposing the action space and leveraging graph neural networks for state representation, Quarl allows for both local and global circuit-wide reasoning. This optimizer significantly outperforms existing circuit optimizers on benchmark circuits and can even learn complex optimizations like rotation merging.
