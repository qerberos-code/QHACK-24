# Quantum Circuit Types

1. **"dj"** - Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm: A quantum algorithm used to determine if a given Boolean function is constant or balanced with a single query to the function, demonstrating quantum parallelism.

2. **"ghz"** - GHZ State: A type of multipartite entangled state, named after Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger, which exhibits correlations that are stronger than those allowed by classical systems.

3. **"graphstate"** - Graph State: A type of multipartite entangled state where the qubits are represented by vertices of a graph, and entanglement is defined by the edges connecting these vertices.

4. **"qft"** - Quantum Fourier Transform: A quantum algorithm that performs the Fourier transform on the amplitudes of a quantum state, which is fundamental in many quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large integers.

5. **"qftentangled"** - Entangled Quantum Fourier Transform: Quantum Fourier Transform applied to entangled qubits, allowing for more complex quantum operations and potentially offering computational advantages over classical approaches.

6. **"realamprandom"** - Real Amplitude Randomization: A quantum algorithmic technique used for sampling from probability distributions, leveraging interference effects to efficiently generate random samples.

7. **"su2random"** - SU(2) Random Circuit: A quantum circuit composed of random single-qubit gates and two-qubit SU(2) gates, often used for benchmarking quantum devices and studying random quantum dynamics.

8. **"twolocalrandom"** - Two-Local Random Circuit: A quantum circuit architecture where the gates act on pairs of qubits only, offering a compromise between the simplicity of local gates and the power of more global entangling gates.

9. **"wstate"** - W State: A specific type of multipartite entangled state where one qubit is entangled with the rest in a highly entangled manner, while the other qubits are not entangled with each other.

10. **"ae"** - Amplitude Estimation: A quantum algorithmic technique used for estimating the probability of a certain outcome of a quantum computation, which is valuable in various quantum algorithms for solving problems efficiently.

11. **"qpeexact"** - Quantum Phase Estimation (Exact): A quantum algorithm for estimating the eigenvalues of unitary operators with high precision, forming a crucial component in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm.

12. **"qpeinexact"** - Quantum Phase Estimation (Inexact): A variant of Quantum Phase Estimation that allows for approximate eigenvalue estimation, potentially offering computational advantages when high precision is not necessary or feasible.
